"""
This function answers to the user given inputs. Data is a dictionary that contains
the informations about the flight such as departure location, arrival, etc. while
modified is used to know if a given information has changed in Data.
This function uses guess.py to evaluate the word that is weighting the most,
as a way to try to grab the meaning of the inputed sentence.
